## Features

* **Autonomous Multi-Stage Hacking:** Executes complex attack chains with user confirmation at each stage.
* **Modular Plugin System:** Easily extend functionality with custom modules and payloads.
* **AI-Driven Exploit & Payload Generation:** Uses ML to craft novel exploits and adapt payloads in real time.
* **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Pulls live CVE data and threat feeds to stay ahead of the curve.
* **Self-Learning Engine:** Continuously retrains on new data and outcomes to improve performance.
* **Stealth & Anonymization:** Supports VPNs, Tor, proxy chaining, and spoofing for covert ops.
* **CCTV & IoT Exploitation:** Live feed access and control of vulnerable smart devices.
* **Malware Simulation in Isolated VMs:** Test crypto-jacking, ransomware, and more in safe environments.
* **Emergency Kill Switch:** Instantly halt or roll back operations with a single command.
* **Bug Bounty API Integration:** Auto-report findings to platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd.
* **Distributed AI Training:** Train models across cloud/swarm environments for scalability.
* **Adaptive Defense Detection:** Identifies and counters blue team responses in real time.
* **Image-Based Targeting:** Use photos (e.g., buildings) to identify and breach associated networks.
* **Wallet & Coin Management:** Proxy wallets, stealth transfers, and crypto asset tracking.
* **Idle-Time Learning:** Optional background training when the system is idle.
* **Steganography & Covert Channels:** Secure communication via hidden data streams.
* **Hardware-Aware Tool Suggestions:** Detects system specs and recommends optimal tools.
* **Explainable AI Reports:** Real-time reasoning and decision logs for transparency.
